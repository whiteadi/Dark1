# Dark1

Xamarin mobile app client for https://github.com/Sv443/JokeAPI used as playground

To learn how xamarin setup works to build a cross platform mobile app I used the free aforementioned api to fect only dark jokes :)

To realease it: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/deploy-test/release-prep/?tabs=windows

or you can ask me to send you the apk or .ipa ;)
